**HoriWiki**[&sup1;](#notec1) is an open-source online encyclopedia/wiki launched by [Horibyte](Horibyte) on 4 May 2025. Its main purpose is documenting meanings of inside jokes to random things from the Horiverse.

Initially it was planned that HoriWiki was to be powered by MediaWiki with a custom user interface, however it was decided to instead build a separate wiki engine deemed the "HoriWiki Engine", using the Jekyll static site generator.

As of 7 May 2025, HoriWiki, available under `/wiki/` of [HoriWebsite](HoriWebsite)'s domain (`horibyte.is-a.dev`), currently has at least 7 articles and growing. The HoriWiki Engine reached alpha status on 6 May 2025, and is primarily developed by Horibyte, with other tweaks/adjustments having been done by Clyron.
