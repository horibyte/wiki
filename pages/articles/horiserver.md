**HoriServer**[&sup1;](#notec1) is a server on the Discord alternative [Revolt](https://revolt.chat). It was created on 3 February 2025 as a result of and was primarily active during [Horibyte](Horibyte)'s prolonged Discord break throughout February 2025.

A private server, its main purpose is to serve as a fallback limited space with Horibyte and their friends. Horibyte has stated that they joined Revolt (and thus create the server) to not "be alone for the 3rd time in my [Horibyte's] life". A wave of several few people have joined Revolt for HoriServer in the immediate aftermath of Horibyte departing Discord.

As of May 2025, the server still exists and remains fully open, but has remained mostly inactive after Horibyte's comeback to Discord. At the moment it is unlikely the server will ever be used again due to Horibyte's changing opinion on the Revolt platform itself.

At its peak in February, the Revolt server ran alongside the [StuffyXP Hangout](StuffyXP_Hangout) Discord server, which continued to be ran separately by Clyron, next in the server's management after Horibyte. Following the [sunsetting of the StuffyXP channels](StuffyXP#Closure), a successor Discord server was created, bearing the name [HoriServer (2)](HoriServer_(2)), considered to be the spiritual successor to "HoriServer" on Revolt.

The public server structure consists of:
- The **Important** category
   - Contains the channels "Rules", "Announcements" and "Joins & Co."
- The **Main** category
   - Contains the general chat channel, as well as the "Photos & Videos" and "Gaming" channels, along with a starboard
- The **Silly** category
   - Contains various meme, [HoriCulture](List_of_Horibyte_memes_culture) or chain channels
