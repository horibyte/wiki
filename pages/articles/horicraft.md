**Horicraft**[&sup1;](#notec1) (*formerly known as the **StuffyXP Minecraft Server***) was a creative Minecraft server owned and operated by [Horibyte](Horibyte). It was initially announced by them on 3 December 2024, on the [StuffyXP Hangout](StuffyXP_Hangout) Discord Server, however it would only begin gaining significant popularity from late January 2025.

Main cities built in Horicraft include [Horilandese](Horiland) cities like the capital [Fucking](Fucking) or [Jell](Jell). As the world spawn, Fucking is home to most of Horicraft's players as well as facitilies like [Dogui Heavy Industries Incorporated](Dogui_Heavy_Industries_Incorporated). Jell is mainly known for its tourist attraction, the *B Parkour*, shaped as a üÖ±Ô∏è cube.

Players of Horicraft can travel between Jell, Fucking, or other places across the Horicraft world using the *Horicraft Underground Rail System* (HURS, using minecarts), *Horicraft Water Transportation System* (HWTS, using boats), or using Nether Portals or pathes in cities by foot.

Horicraft officially shut down on 11 March 2025 after a disagreement between the server hoster and Horibyte, after just over 3 months. Any instance of the original Horicraft that would remain open would no longer be official/endorsed by Horibyte. It was later succeeded by [Horicraft (2)](Horicraft_(2)), a survival Minecraft server.
