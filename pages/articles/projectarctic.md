**Project Arctic**[&sup1;](#notec1){: id="note1"} is an unreleased operating system by [Horibyte](Horibyte) originally ""announced"" on Early 2024[&sup2;](#notec2){: id="note2"}.<br>A lot of references to Arctic have been in Horibyte's messages and works to the point of making a mockup of said OS in 2024...before a [Horibyte moment](Horibyte_Moments) interrupted the process.

The OS' kernel has been compiled 2 total times in early 2025 but never has been publicly shared by Horibyte due to them losing the `kernel.bin` file(s).
