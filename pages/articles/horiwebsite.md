### Overview

The website features a home page, blog, socials, projects, art and about me page.

### Early Development

Development of HoriWebsite started on May 2024 under the name "Stuffy's Website", an early development showcase video was uploaded to the [StuffyXP Extras](StuffyXP_Extras) YouTube channel on May 10 2024, but it was taken down on March 14 2025 due to the [closure of the StuffyXP channels](StuffyXP#Closure). The video showed the website with a separate-page layout, making the Socials page be in `/socials/`, etc.

### Stuffy's Website

A Public Beta of the new website, being announced in June of the same year, said beta was released to the public in June 22 2024, an archive can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240622170614/https://stuffyxp.github.io/).

The website was fully launched on June 24 2024, still under the name of "Stuffy's Website", ditching the separate-page layout with a new tabbed layout, powered by [Bulma](https://bulma.io) 1.0's tab feature, looking similar to Clyron's (Lynxmic's) website. An archive of the website can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240624005112/https://stuffyxp.github.io/).

The website's first update, "Week One Update" (shortened to WOU) was released on July of the same year, despite the build string reporting June 24, this update also introduced version codenames.

### StuffyXP Website

Shortly after the rebirth of StuffyXP, the website's layout changed again to acomodate StuffyXP's new look, so called "StuffyXP Website" was launched in mid-2024. This was the website version that had the most support, being from August 2024 to December 2024 (4 months).

The website went back to the separate-page layout, with its navbar being similar to that of StuffyWebsite 0.1, the website is still up at [horibyte.is-a.dev/stuffyxp-website](https://horibyte.is-a.dev/stuffyxp-website/), with the latest version being 2.1.2.

#### Update 2.1(.x)

STXP Website Update 2.1 was the biggest update ever to the STXP Website, updating both the front-end and back-end of the website, it's the version Horibyte's most proud of. Updates 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 were minor updates to fix & update some missed things, 2.1.2 was a version to fix the migration issues between `stuffyxp.github.io` and `horibyte.is-a.dev` in StuffyXP Website and Stuffy's Website.

### Horibyte's Website/HoriWebsite
