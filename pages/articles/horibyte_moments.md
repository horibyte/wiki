**Horibyte Moments** (*formerly known as **Stuffy Moments***) are moments when Horibyte breaks any sort of tech (that being software, hardware, services, etc) in an unexpected way. They were introduced in January 2024.

### Types of Horibyte moments
Horibyte moments can vary from a range of 'moment levels', with that being the following:
 * **Errors**: Said moments can be various errors, being just normal ones, or something extremely rare.<br>

* **Software Gore**: These moments are when software breaks in a funny and weird way, these are the most common Horibyte Moments.<br>
