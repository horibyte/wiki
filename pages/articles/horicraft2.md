**Horicraft (2)** is a survival Minecraft server owned & operated by [Horibyte](Horibyte) founded on March 14 2025. It is the spiritual successor to the [original Horicraft server](Horicraft) after being closed due to a disagreement between the server hoster and Horibyte.

The server runs FabricMC as its base, and is self-hosted by Horibyte themselves. 

Horibyte and Clyron are the first members of Horicraft (2), both joined shortly after the server was online for its first time, Horibyte's YouTube channel has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3bE3yBXduY&t=25s) of both playing in the server in its early days.
